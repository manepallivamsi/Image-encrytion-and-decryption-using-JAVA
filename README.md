# XOR ALGORITHM

# Definition

The XOR encryption algorithm is an example of symmetric encryption where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt a message.

The XOR Encryption algorithm is a very effective method of symmetric encryption. Due to its effectiveness and simplicity, the XOR Encryption is an extremely common component used in more complex encryption algorithms used nowadays.

The XOR Encryption algorithm is based on applying an XOR mask using the plaintext and a key
XOR encryption algorithm can be applied to any digital/binary information, including text based information encoded using the 8-bit ASCII code. In this case the encryption key can be expressed as a string of characters.

By itself, the XOR encryption can be very robust if:

1.It is based on a long key that will not repeat itself. (e.g. a key that contains as many bits/characters as the plaintext)

2.A new key is randomly generated for any new communication.

3.The key is kept secret by both the sender and the receiver.

When a large quantity of text is to be encrypted, a shorter repeating encryption key is used to match the length of the plain text. However, re-using the same key over and over, or using a shorter repeating key results in a less secure method where the cipher text could be decrypted using a frequency analysis.

XOR Encryption is an encryption method used to encrypt data and is hard to crack by brute-force method, i.e generating random encryption keys to match with the correct one. 

# Why image encryption?

Nowadays, information security is becoming more important in data storage and transmission.

Images are widely used in different-different processes. Therefore, the security of image data from unauthorized uses is important.

Image encryption plays an important role in the field of information hiding.

Image encryption method prepared information unreadable. Therefore, no hacker or eavesdropper, including server administrators and others, have access to original message or any other type of transmitted information through public networks such as internet
